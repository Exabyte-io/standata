Kamal Choudhary , Kevin F. Garrity

We introduce a computational framework (InterMat) to predict band offsets of semiconductor interfaces using density functional theory
(DFT) and graph neural networks (GNN). As a first step, we benchmark OptB88vdW generalized gradient approximation (GGA) work
functions and electron affinities for surfaces against experimental data with accuracies of 0.29 eV and 0.39 eV, respectively. Similarly, we
evaluate band offset values using independent unit (IU) and alternate slab junction (ASJ) models leading to accuracies of 0.45 eV and 0.22
eV, respectively. We use bulk band structure calculations with the TBmBJ meta-GGA functional to correct for band gap underestimation
when predicting conduction band properties. During ASJ structure generation, we use Zur’s algorithm along with a unified GNN force-field
to tackle the conformation challenges of interface design. At present, we have 607 surface work functions calculated with DFT, from
which we can compute 183921 IU band offsets as well as 593 directly calculated ASJ band offsets. Finally, as the space of all possible
heterojunctions is too large to simulate with DFT, we develop generalized GNN models to quickly predict bulk band edges with an accuracy
of 0.26 eV. We show how these models can be used to predict relevant quantities including ionization potentials, electron affinities, and
IU-based band offsets. We establish simple rules using the above models to pre-screen potential semiconductor devices from a vast pool
of nearly 1.4 trillion candidate interfaces. InterMat is available at website: https://github.com/usnistgov/intermat

Introduction
Interfaces are critical for a variety of technological applications including semiconductor transistors and diodes, solid-state lighting
devices, solar-cells, data-storage and battery applications 1–8 . In particular, the continued scaling of semiconductor devices towards the
atomic limit 9 makes interface properties even more important and a focus area of recent investments in research and development
including the Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors (CHIPS) act 10 . While interfaces are ubiquitous, predicting even
basic interface properties from bulk data or chemical models remains challenging. There have been numerous scientific efforts to model
interfaces with a variety of techniques including density functional theory (DFT) 11–20 , force-field 21–24 , tight-binding 25–28 and machine
learning techniques 19,29–31 . However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no systematic investigation of interfaces for a large class
of structural variety and chemical compositions. Most of the previous efforts focus on a limited number of interfaces, and hence there
is a need for a dedicated infrastructure for data-driven interface materials design.
Some of the key quantities for determining interface properties are: equilibrium geometries, energetics, work functions, ionization
potentials, electron affinities, band offsets, carrier effective masses, mobilities, and thermal conductivities. Calculations of band offsets
and band-alignment at semiconductor heterojunctions are of special interest for device design. Semiconductor device transport and
performance depend critically on valence band offsets (∆Ev ) and conduction band offsets (∆Ec ), as well as interfacial roughness and
defects 32–34 . Based on the band-alignment, heterostructures can be categorized into three classes: (i) type-I (straddling gap), (ii) typeII (staggered gap), and (iii) type-III (broken gap). The type-I heterostructures are used for transistors, lasers and light-emitting diode
(LED) applications, type-II are used for photoabsorbers and photocatalysts, and type-III are used for tunneling field effect transistors.
Experimentally, band offsets can be measured using optical spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS), and electrical measurements 5 . However, these experiments can be quite time and resource consuming.
Additionally, the variability across multiple reported measurements can be reasonably high. For example, the reported AlN/GaN interface ∆Ev varies from 0.57 eV to 1.36 eV with reported uncertainties of up to 0.24 eV 34 . In this respect, the computation of band offsets
can serve as a complementary tool to experimental analysis. Nevertheless, the calculation of band offsets is rather challenging 35 and
has been an area of research for about a century 36–38 . Density functional theory (DFT) calculations are one of the most widely used
techniques for predicting band offsets, as they can describe the electronic and atomic structures at the interface in a self-consistent
manner. There are two main approaches to predicting band offsets using DFT. The first is to directly simulate the interface using either
an alternating slab-junction (ASJ)/superlattice or surface terminated junction (STJ)/slab vacuum geometry, either of which requires a
computationally expensive calculation for each pair of materials. Alternatively, the independent unit (IU)/electron affinity/Anderson’s
model 16,39 requires only independent surface calculations of each material, greatly reducing computational cost but ignoring specific
interface effects. ASJ models were shown to be most accurate in Ref. 16 , but IU models are surprisingly competitive.

Importantly, the generation of an atomistic interface geometry is a challenging task due to the high number of possible conformations
and configurations. There are several important factors determining an interface such as: the selection of the lattice alignment, the
relative orientation/displacement between surfaces, the separation distance, point/line defects, and the presence of interfacial charge
transfer. Several previous tools have attempted to address this challenge, including MPInterfaces 18 , TribChem 40 and QuantumATK 41
packages.
Moreover, DFT calculations of interfaces require initial pre-relaxed bulk structures which in this work are obtained from the Joint Automated Repository for Various Integrated Simulations (JARVIS)-DFT 42,43 database containing nearly 80000 bulk 3D and 1100 2D materials. The JARVIS-DFT originated about 5 years ago and contains millions of properties materials and has carefully converged atomic
structures with tight convergence parameters, various exchange-correlation functionals such as OptB88vdW 44 , TBmBJ 45 , R2SCAN 46
and HSE06 47 . JARVIS-DFT contains metallic, semiconducting, insulator, superconductor , high-strength, topological, solar, thermoelectric, piezoelectric , dielectric, two-dimensional, magnetic, porous, defect and various other classes of bulk materials 48,49 . We have
also previously looked at the band alignment of layered two dimensional materials using JARVIS-DFT 19 . However, three dimensional
systems with chemical bonding between the materials require much greater effort, as the interfacial bonding has a much greater effect
on the interface properties, and the determination of even a single interface structure is a challenging task. Out of the above material
class combinations, semiconductor-semiconductor are of special interest for this work. As DFT calculations can be time-consuming for
surfaces and interfaces machine-learning (ML)/deep learning (DL) techniques based on DFT data can be used to accelerate atomistic
predictions 50,51 . Such models have often been applied for bulk property predictions and their applicability for defects and interfaces
remains an open question. Several machine learning tools available in JARVIS such as classical force-field inspired descriptors (CFID) 43 ,
atomistic line graph neural network (ALIGNN) 52,53 , computer vision for atomistic images (AtomVision) 54 and natural language processing for chemistry (ChemNLP) 55 can be used in this regards to accelerate the interface design tasks. In particular, ALIGNN has been
used to develop several fast surrogate models for property predictions as well as a unified force-field for fast structure optimizations.
Most importantly, for all the above predictions, it is important to benchmark and quantify error with respect to experimental data
to gain confidence in the prediction methodology. This work addresses the above challenges and provides a streamlined framework
for semiconductor interface design (InterMat). Although focusing on semiconductors, this work has relevance to other applications
such as battery, data-storage, and solar-cell devices. We believe that this work will be a precursor to more thorough theoretical and
experimental investigations of semiconductor interfaces.

Results and discussion
A schematic overview of InterMat along with the combinatorial problem of interfaces is shown in Fig. 1. InterMat can be used to
generate surface and interface structures, perform multi-fidelity calculations to predict properties, analyze and benchmark data against
experiments, and train and utilize machine learning models based on the resulting data. Initial atomic structures can be obtained
from the JARVIS-DFT repository. As an example of the combinatorial challenge of interfaces, we can consider starting with the 20901
semiconductors in the JARVIS-DFT databsae with OptB88vdW band gaps between 0.1 eV and 6 eV. Using a maximum Miller index (M)
of 1, 2, and 3, the number of symmetrically distinct surface slabs are 186847, 591639 and 1642584, respectively. Using these surfaces,
the number of binary interface systems that can be generated are 17.5 billion, 175 billion and 1.4 trillion. Including the possibility of
different atomic surface terminations, reconstructions, and defects further complicates matters.
It is unrealistic to analyze such a large search space to find combinations for device applications by using conventional experimental
or computational techniques. We will instead use ALIGNN models trained on bulk materials to guide and prioritize DFT calculations
among the vast pool of candidate surfaces and interfaces. We develop machine learning models for fast predictions of valence band
maxima (VBM) and conduction band minima (CBM) using ALIGNN on JARVIS-DFT bulk material dataset. These predictions can
be further used for fast IU based band alignment using electron affinity/Anderson’s rule 39 . To assess the strengths and limitations
of such models, we develop a surface dataset for independent unit (IU) models and an interface dataset for alternate slab junction
(ASJ)/superlattice models using DFT. We particularly focus on industrially relevant semiconductors including group IV (C, Si, Ge etc.),
III-IV (AlN, GaN, GaAs, GaP, InSb etc.), II-VI (CdS, CdSe, ZnO, ZnS etc.). We also assess the strengths and limitations of IU and
ASJ models against experimental measurements. This DFT dataset can then be fed back into the ALIGNN models to further improve
accuracy.
DFT surface dataset: work function, electron affinity, ionization potential and surface energy
We develop a dataset of non-polar unreconstructed slab surfaces using the JARVIS-DFT workflow and bulk material dataset. Examples
of silicon and gallium arsenide bulk atomic structures are shown in Fig. 2a and Fig. 2b respectively. Next, we generate surface slab
structures with a thickness of 1.6 nm and vacuum padding of 1.2 nm, as shown in Fig. 2c. Recently, it was shown that vacuum and
slab thicknesses of at least 10 Å are sufficient for surface models 76 . During the DFT calculations, the converged k-point 77 values from
the relevant bulk calculations are used for surfaces. We optimize the internal coordinates of these surfaces keeping the cell volume
constant.
We carefully benchmark surface energy (γ), ionization potential (IP), electron affinity (χ), and work function (φ ) values against

Fig. 1 Schematic overview of the workflow. InterMat can be used to generate surface and interface geometric structures (Geom.), perform multi-fidelity
calculations (such as density functional theory, force-field, tight-binding and machine learning) to predict properties (such as surface energy, interface
formation energy, band offset, work function, ionization potential, electron affinity), analyze and benchmark data against experiments, and utilize
machine learning models for such data. The number of possible semiconductor-semiconductor interfaces is exceedingly large. The workflow aims to
provide a toolkit to generate interface structures and use multi-fidelity methods to accelerate interface/heterostructure design.

experimental measurements from the literature. The surface energy (γ) can be calculated using the formula:
Eslab − Nbulk · Ebulk
(1)
2A
where (Eslab ) is the total energy of the relaxed slab model, (Nbulk ) is the number of bulk-like atoms in the slab model, (Ebulk ) is the
energy per atom in the bulk material, and (A) is the surface area of the slab model. The factor of 2 accounts for the fact that there are
two surfaces in the non-polar slab model (top and bottom).
We obtain the valence band maximum (VBM) and vacuum level (Evac ) of surface slabs from DFT calculations using the OptB88vdW
functional. The work function is obtained by subtracting the vacuum level from the Fermi level (φ = Evac − EF ). Similarly, the ionization
potential is the difference between the VBM and Evac . Then, we add the electronic bandgap (Eg ) of the bulk material to the ionization
potential to get the electron affinity (EA, χ). Semi-local DFT has proven quite effective in describing the valence bands of materials
but is known to underestimate band gaps. For accurate prediction of both valence and conduction bands, particularly in materials with
complex electronic interactions, higher-level theories like many-body perturbation theory (e.g. GW calculations) might be necessary,
but are computationally very expensive. In order to address this problem in a more computationally efficient manner, we make use
of bulk band gaps from the JARVIS-DFT database computed using the TBmBJ metaGGA functional. TBmBJ predictions can provide
band gap descriptions with accuracy close to more expensive methods but at an order of magnitude less computational cost 78 , which
is important for high-throughput studies. We calculate surface conduction band quantities by first calculating the valence band at the
GGA-level using OptB88vdW and then add to that the TBmBJ bulk gap to get the conduction band minimum (CBM). Performing full
surface calculations using hybrid functionals or GW is beyond the scope of the present work because of excessive computational cost,
but we plan to provide further tests of those approaches in the future 14,15 .
In order to benchmark our surface dataset, we compare work functions, electron affinities, and surface energies of several dozen
surfaces with experimental data in Table. 1. We find excellent agreement for the work functions, with a mean absolute error value of
0.29 eV, consistent with previous benchmarking efforts 79 . Similarly, we obtain a mean absolute error of 0.39 eV and 0.34 Jm−2 for the
electron affinity and surface energy, respectively. Currently, we have performed calculations on 607 surfaces using the workflow, and
the dataset is still growing. Using, these 607 surfaces, 183921 IU-band offsets can be predicted. Also, we plan to include reconstructed

and polar surfaces in the future.
DFT Interface dataset: alternate slab junction (ASJ) band alignment
We next consider explicit DFT calculations of interfaces, which first require generating candidate interface structures. This can be done
in either of the following two ways: 1) by attaching the two surface slabs together without vacuum padding, creating a superlattice or
alternating slab junction (ASJ) structure, or 2) by attaching the two surface slabs with vacuum padding, creating a surface terminated
junction (SJT) structure. We have focused on the ASJ approach 16,80 . After obtaining surface slab structures as discussed in the previous section, we generate the interfaces following the Zur et. al. algorithm 81 . The Zur algorithm generates a number of superlattice
transformations within a specified maximum surface area and also evaluates the length and angle between film and substrate superlattice vectors to determine if they can match within a tolerance. This algorithm is applicable to different crystal structures and their
2

surface orientations. We use a maximum lattice mismatch of 8 %, maximum area of 300 Å , and maximum angle tolerance of 1 degree.
Note that in previous studies, lattice mismatch of 20 % has been reported 14,82 . An example of the application of the algorithm to the
Si(110)/GaAs(110) interface is shown in Fig. 2d with several lattice length and angle mismatches (∆u and ∆θ ) as well as maximum
area. After eliminating structures with area higher than max-area tolerance and structures with mismatch angle more than the specified
angle threshold, we then choose the remaining structure (if any) with the minimum mismatch lattice vector lengths.
The Zur algorithm determines a candidate unit cell, but the relative alignment of the structures in the in-plane, as well as the slab
terminations still need to be decided. For the in-plane alignment, we perform a grid search of possible options with a spacing interval of
0.05 fractional coordinates to determine the initial structure for further relaxation. Doing such a large number of calculations with DFT
would be prohibitive, so we use ALIGNN-FF 53 to identify the starting in-plane alignment. ALIGNN-FF is a universal force field ML model
developed using JARVIS-DFT data with 307113 structures and can be used to model combinations of 89 elements from the periodic
table. An example of ALIGNN-FF predictions of an in-plane grid search is shown in Fig. 2e. For the Si/GaAs(110) case, we also perform

corresponding DFT calculations as shown in Fig. 2f. Here high-peaks (yellow color using magma colormap) usually represent too close
atoms during the translation operations, which should be avoided. Clearly, the DFT contours are smoother than ALIGNN-FF because
of its relatively rough potential energy surface (PES). Nevertheless, the minimums of the contours, which are of interest for in-plane
alignments, closely resemble each other. As the ALIGNN-FF accuracy increases with more data, we expect to get much smoother PES in
future. After the ALIGNN-FF calculations to select the initial alignment, a full DFT relaxation is performed.
For computational purposes, it is important to have a unique identifier for an interface. While generating the interfaces, we use
a naming convention to include a) material IDs (such as JVASP-1002 for Si and JVASP-1174 for GaAs), b) film and substrate Miller
indices (such as 110 for each), c) film and substrate thickness values (such as 16 Å each), d) separation between these two surface
slabs (such as 2.5 Å for an ASJ model, 18 Å for STJ interface models), e) relative displacement in xy-plane (such as a displacement
vector of [0.5, 0.2]), f) calculator method (such as DFT (VASP), ALIGNN-FF etc.) giving rise to an interface with a name such as:
Interface-JID1_JID2_film_miller_M1_sub_miller_M2_film_thickness_T1_subs_thickness_T2_separation_S_disp _X_Y_vasp (where JID1
is JVASP-1002, JID2 is JVASP-1174, M1 and M2 are both 1_1_0, T1 and T2 are 16, S is 2.5, X is 0.5, Y is 0.2). Such a scheme
helps to reproduce the unique interfaces. Of course, realistically, more complex parameters for an interface can be important such as
terminations, reconstructions, misfit-dislocation, vacancies on the interface etc., but they can be easily included in the naming scheme
as well later.
After selecting a good guess of the interface using the above approach, DFT calculations are performed to calculate quantities
such as the interface formation energy and the band offset value. During the DFT calculations, the more converged k-point grids and
energy cutoffs of the two constituent bulk materials 77 is used. An example of the Si(110) and GaAs(110) interface is shown in Fig.
3a. Furthermore, we can project the electron density of states across the cell dimension in Fig.4 to show how electronic states are
distributed along the interface region. We observe the GaAs gap decrease near the silicon region. Such analysis can help to understand
the local band alignment and atomic character, which are important for device modeling.
After determining the optimized geometric structure for the interface using DFT, we obtain the interface formation energy and
valence band offset data using the formalism detailed in Ref. 83 and Ref. 11 respectively. As an example, we show a detailed analysis of

Si(110)/GaAs(110) and AlN(001)/GaN(001) in Fig. 3. The interface formation energy (γ f ) is calculated using the formula:
γ f A = Etot − ∑ ni µi

(2)

where γ interface formation energy, Etot is the total energy of the superlattice, µi is the chemical potential of the specie i, ni is the
number of atoms of the specie i, and A is the interface unit cell area. Using the bulk materials energy per atom in its most stable form
in JARVIS-DFT and OptB88vdW functional, we obtain an interface formation energy of -0.056 Jm−2 for the Si(110)/GaAs(110) system.
A negative formation energy suggests a feasible formation of the interface. Moreover, such interface formation energies with varying
chemical potentials of the constituent elements can provide information about the thermodynamic stability of the interface in different
growth conditions. Such detailed tasks for individual interfaces will be carried in future.
In Fig. 3a, we show the atomic structure of the ASJ based heterostructure of Si(110)/GaAs(110). The left side (with blue atoms)
represents the Si and the right side is the GaAs region. In Fig. 3c, we show the electrostatic potential profile, averaged in-plane, of
the interface. The approximately sinusoidal profile on both regions represents the presence of atomic layers. The cyan lines show
the region used to define the repeat distance, L, used for averaging in each material (see below). The red and green lines show the
average potential profiles for the left and right parts using the repeat distance. The valence band offset (∆Ev ) of an interface between
semiconductor A and B, ∆Ev is obtained using eq. 4. The difference in the averages for the left and right parts gives the ∆V term. Now
the bulk VBMs of the left and right parts are also calculated to determine the ∆E. The sum of these two quantities gives the valence
band offset that can be compared to experiments.
∆Ev (A/B) = (EvB − EvA ) + ∆V

∆V = V̄¯A − V̄¯B

Here, EvA (EvB ) represents the position of the VBM with respect to the average electrostatic potential in the bulk material A (B), and ∆V

the average along the repeat unit L of V̄ , which is the planar averaged electrostatic potential:

where, L is the distance between repeat units and S is the area which is parallel to the interface. The corresponding conduction-band

convention that a positive value of the valence-band offset at an interface A/B indicates that the VBM is higher in material B. For the
GaAs/Si interface we obtain ∆Ev of 0.31 eV and 0.39 eV using OptB88vdW and R2SCAN functionals, respectively, which is in close
agreement with the experimental value of 0.23 eV.

Table. 2 we compare some of the ASJ based valence band offsets (∆Ev ) with experimental measurements. We find a mean absolute
error of 0.22 eV and 0.23 eV for OptB88vdW and R2SCAN respectively, which is comparable a value of 0.16 eV from to Liberto et. al.
for a smaller number of systems using the HSE06 functional. In the future, we plan to carry out HSE06 calculations for surfaces as
well as interfaces to further improve the quality of predictions. These benchmarks will also be available in the JARVIS-Leaderboard
platform 103 as well. Out of numerous possible combinations, only 593 DFT calculations of ASJ-based interfaces are available right now
and the database is still growing.

DFT-based independent unit (IU) band alignment
IU band alignment, also known as Anderson’s rule 39 , predicts semiconductor band offsets at interfaces using only the IP and EA data
from independent surface calculations. For a semiconductor heterojunction between A and B, the conduction band offset is given by:
∆Ec = χB − χA

(7)

∆Ev = (χA + EgA ) − (χB + EgB )

(8)

Similarly, the valence band offset is given by:
In Fig.6a, we show the DFT-based IU band alignments for a set of well-known semiconductor surfaces. We also include dotted lines for
the energy levels of H2 and H2 O, which are relevant for photo-catalyst applications. We compare the DFT based IU band offsets for 8
interfaces in Table 2 against experiments. We find a mean absolute error of 0.45 eV which is similar to a value of 0.32 eV as found in
ref. 16 for different systems.
ALIGNN-based IU alignment from bulk data
We seek to accelerate the prediction of band edges using ML models, but the absolute prediction of band edges relative to vacuum
requires DFT calculations with surfaces, which are too computationally expensive to create a robust dataset. JARVIS-DFT contains a
much larger dataset of three dimensional materials with CBM and VBM values. Here, the CBMs and VBMs are simply the band edges
written out by VASP for the bulk materials dataset using OptB88vdW. These band edges use the VASP convention that the average
electrostatic potential of a unit cell is set to zero, and are not directly comparable to experimental values. A surface calculation with
explicit vacuum is necessary to align the VBM/CBM to vacuum. We first train an ML model using ALIGNN based on these bulk quantities,
but we will then show that this model is somewhat surprisingly also useful for predictions of band edges relative to vacuum.
To train the ALIGNN model, we split each bulk VBM/CBM dataset into 90:5:5 train:validation:test parts. We train on 90 % train
data and evaluate the validation and test data using ALIGNN. We find a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.28 ev for CBM and VBM.
We note that the CBM/VBM data can vary from -10 to 10 eV (as shown in Fig. 5a,b) suggesting that the model should be reasonable
for predictions. The mean absolute deviation (MAD) for the CBM and VBM are 2.08 eV and 2.67 eV, respectively, so the MAD:MAE is
nearly 10 relative to a trivial baseline model. Out of several other material properties trained using ALIGNN 52 , CBM/VBM models has
one of the highest MAD:MAE ratios, especially compared to other electronic properties like the band gap. We show the CBM and VBM
prediction models in Fig.5a and Fig.5b respectively. We believe with more data using the active learning loop we can further increase
the MAD:MAE in future 50 .

Next, we evaluate the bulk-trained ALIGNN models on the DFT surface dataset and show results in Fig.5c and Fig.5c for CBM and
VBM respectively. We note that the training data does not include any surfaces. Nevertheless, most of the data points are on x = y line
suggesting excellent agreement. We find MAE values of 0.55 eV and 0.96 eV for VBM and CBM respectively. This level of agreement
is surprising because the value of the averaged electrostatic potential will change as the ratio of vacuum thickness to slab thickness
changes. We also note that the error in CBM is higher than that of VBM, perhaps an explanation for why predicting band gaps of
materials using machine learning is ever-standing difficult problem.
Up to this point, our model can only predict quantities relative to a cell-averaged electrostatic potential, which cannot be directly
compared to experiment. However, we observe that our ALIGNN model predictions of the bulk VBM/CBM are in fact strongly correlated
with the VBM/CBM values calculated with respect to vacuum using DFT calculations of surface slabs. We can get useful predictions of
the vacuum-aligned VBM by subtracting a heuristic constant value of 10 eV from the ALIGNN predictions, and adding the bulk TBmBJ
band gap to get the corresponding CBM. We visualize this IU based band alignment using ALIGNN model in Fig. 6b. We observe that
the overall trends of DFT and ALIGNN closely resemble each other. For these surfaces, we calculate the classification accuracy of the
heterostructures in type-I, type-II and type-III heterostructures. We find precision scores of 66.7 %, 66.1 % and 58.2 % respectively.
Precision is defined as the fraction of relevant instances among all of the retrieved instances. The classification precision scores are
based on DFT optimized surfaces, which are not available for all the materials in the database. So, we generate structures directly from
the bulk counterparts, relax them using ALIGNN-FF and then predict the electron affinity and ionization potentials using the procedure
mentioned above. In this way, we find precision scores of 55.0 %, 63.4 % and 60.0 % respectively suggesting that structure optimization
of surfaces has an impact on the ALIGNN predictions. The random baseline is 1/3 = 33 %, which is more than 2 times lower than what
we achieve.
As an example of the type of analysis that can be done with this data, we analyze all hetrostructures where the film is silicon.
As shown in Fig. 7, we identify which elements in the second semiconductor make it most likely that the hetrostructrue will have a
Type-1/straddling band alignment appropriate for diode applications. We find these elements to be Al, P, S, N, O, Li which is consistent
with known silicon devices. Many other analyses are possible, we provide this data in hopes that it will be useful to the community.
Sufficiently high precision scores suggest that such models can be used for pre-screening applications followed by density functional
theory calculations and experiments. Also, as the DFT bulk, surface and interface dataset is growing continuously, there is plenty of
scope to improve the model performance in the future. For the 1.4 trillion semiconductor interfaces, we find 294 billion as type-I, 322
billion as type-II and rest as type-III heterostructures using the ALIGNN+IU model. The results suggest that finding type-I interfaces for
transistor applications is more challenging than other heterostructure applications. Having such a large number of options and further
screened for desirable properties such as effective masses, dielectric, piezoelectric, thermoelectric properties etc. can be helpful for
technological applications. We emphasize the point that AI models should be considered as a pre-screening step only and would require
thorough DFT and/or experimental validation.
Given the lack of surface-specific training data, the level of agreement with the unseen surface data is surprising, however, there
are discrepancies in some cases. In other words, the model has never seen bonding environments that occur on slab surfaces, and
extrapolating to such environments is challenging. The goal here is to obtain a fast model that can be used for quick screening of
surfaces, with subsequent DFT calculations for confirmation. It may be possible to finetune this ALIGNN model with a surface dataset
to further improve the accuracy of the model, but we leave that for future work. Nevertheless, the close resemblance in alignment
predictions is promising and suggests that our models can be useful. Similar successful extrapolations for bulk-trained models were
observed in Ref. 104 , which demonstrates that vacancy energies can be predicted from a ML model fit to bulk crystal data only. We
clarify that we are not using a ALIGNN model to predict either the OptB88vdW or TBmBJ band gaps in this work. We are simply looking
up the bulk band gaps in the JARVIS-DFT database, so this does not contribute to the error. However, we do have models for these
quantities with MAEs of 0.14 eV and 0.31 eV respectively (see Ref 52,103 ). For materials not in the JARVIS-DFT database, we could use
these models to predict the gaps.
In summary, we have provided a computational framework and dataset for investigating interface systems using multi-fidelity
computational approaches. We have developed one of the largest datasets, containing 607 surfaces, 183921 IU-band offsets, and 593
ASJ interface band offset using DFT. Using universal graph neural network models, we have quickly screened potential semiconductor
device candidates as transistors from a pool of 1.4 trillion possible interfaces, which would not have been possible using conventional
computational or experimental techniques. Although we have applied this framework for semiconductors, it can be useful for other
technological applications as well. After pre-screening, we have shown and benchmarked this streamlined workflow for band offset
predictions using the independent unit and alternate slab junction models. This work paves the way for the application of materials
design approach to interface systems. All of the tools and datasets developed in this work will be distributed publicly in the spirit of
open-science.

Methods
Graph neural networks are trained using Atomistic Line Graph Neural Network (ALIGNN) framework 52 which uses PyTorch and deep
graph library (DGL). Such GNN models can be used for graph level prediction (such as total energy of the system, bandgap etc.) or
node level predictions (such forces, charges, atomic magnetic moments etc.) In ALIGNN, a crystal structure is represented as a graph

using atomic elements as nodes and atomic bonds as edges. Each node in the atomistic graph is assigned 9 input node features based
on its atomic species: electronegativity, group number, covalent radius, valence electrons, first ionization energy, electron affinity, block
and atomic volume. The inter-atomic bond distances are used as edge features with radial basis function up to 8 Å cut-off and a 12nearest-neighbor (N). This atomistic graph is then used for constructing the corresponding line graph using interatomic bond-distances
as nodes and bond-angles as edge features. ALIGNN uses edge-gated graph convolution for updating nodes as well as edge features
using a propagation function ( f ) for layer (l), atom features (h), and node (i), details of which can be found in Ref. 52,53 :

ALIGNN is trained for 500 epochs and with default parameters in the package. We use a 90:5:5 training:validation:testing randomly
distributed data split for the CBM and VBM of the bulk materials dataset. The data splits and corresponding identifiers used during the
training are made available in the figshare repository. While ALIGNN was used as surrogate/property prediction model at a graph level,
in the later version, we also included atomwise/nodewise property predictions such as forces. These forces are directly derived from the
energies hence leading to force-field development (ALIGNN-FF). ALIGNN-FF was trained on the JARVIS-DFT dataset. Note that, we did
not need to modify the ALIGNN model for surfaces because these GNN are based on the local environment around each atom only. We
have used the same ALIGNN model in molecules 52 and metal-organic frameworks 105 also without changing any architecture and still
leading to accurate results. Next, JARVIS-DFT is a collection of 80000 diverse materials primarily using OptB88vdW in VASP software
following strict protocols for convergence etc. In addition to the datasets, JARVIS-DFT is seamlessly integrated with the JARVIS-tools
package for setting up calculations and performing analysis using a variety of multi-fidelity and multi-scale simulation approaches.
ALIGNN-FF was trained on 307811 bulk structures with 1 million forces obtained from SCF relaxation step for materials in the JARVISDFT. ALIGNN-FF was shown to capture both structural and chemical diversity with reasonable accuracy especially for structure optimization. DFT calculations were carried out using the Vienna Ab-initio simulation package (VASP) software 106,107 with OptB88vdW 44 ,
TBmBJ 45 and R2SCAN 46 functionals using the workflow given on our ‘jarvis-tools’ GitHub page (https://github.com/usnistgov/jarvis
). We use the OptB88vdW functional, which gives accurate lattice parameters for both vdW and non-vdW (3D-bulk) solids. The crystal
structure was optimized until the forces on the ions were less than 0.01 eV/Å and energy less than 10−6 eV. Also, we calculate the local
potential containing ionic plus Hartree contributions to determine the vacuum potential (VAC) of surface slabs. The VAC is subtracted
from the valence band maxima (VBM) and conduction band minima (CBM) to enable the comparison of band-diagrams of individual
slabs in band-alignment diagrams. The converged k-points and cut-off for the bulk materials were also used for the corresponding
surface slab models. The ASJ based interface structures were generated using Zur algorithm 81 available in the JARVIS-Tools. For a
quick scan of xy-displacements for surfaces in the interfaces, ALIGNN-FF was used.
